# TrackSim
Program to build and simulate a car going around a race track

high priority goals
-----

-make carPhysics class calculate physics and output a lap time given some track elements. We need peak radial acceleration and straight line acceleration for this


medium priority goals
-----

-make gui display track elements correctly (broken right now)
-implement a basic gui based track builder


low priority goals
-----
-make a nice gui with resizing and panning around the map 

-read in a CSV file of GPS coordinates and generate a map based on that
