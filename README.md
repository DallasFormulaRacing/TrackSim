# TrackSim
Program to build and simulate a car going around a race track

high priority goals
-----

  Polish up the mostly working track building interface


medium priority goals
-----

  Once the gui is working properly, we want to view the track times in the application. Maybe add another panel displaying track data
  
  Calculate braking distances. This sort of ties into the previous goal but it can and should be implemented separeately and output to the csv file. 
  
  Polish up the gui. We have working sliders and buttons but the formatting is broken (???). The straight/curve toggle buttons don't do anything but this is dependent on some of the other previous goals. Add button doesnt do anything.



low priority goals
-----
-make a nice gui with resizing and panning around the map 

-read in a CSV file of GPS coordinates and generate a map based on that
